   I have a good knowledge of the most popular technologies, libraries and protocols related to PHP. During the years, I had the chance to cooperate on several projects both in team and alone, on development of new applications from scratch and new features/modules for third party preexisting Apps. Below a short list of thechnologies and tools I am mostly used to use:
   PHP, Symfony, Yii, Joomla, Wordpress, Twig, ORM Doctrine, DB MySQL, HTML 5,  CSS 3,  Bootstrap, JSON & Ajax, REST, jQuery, Google APIs, GIT, JIRA.
